String topic in java :

String vs stringBuffer vs stringBulider

in java project if 1000 object is their 
900 object must be string 

why string is immuitabel ? ---> no changeable 	|| stringBuffer is muitable
eg:

string s = new string("durga");			StringBuffer sb = new Stringbuffer("durga");
s.concat("software");---> autoamativ		sb.append("software");
		go to garbage collection
syo(s);		op :durga			syo(sb); op : durgasoftware

1)once we create string obj			1) once we create stringbuffer obj
we arenot allowed to perform any		we are allowed to perform new opera 
chnages in the object 

2)any changes need to done we must
create new object tp performe opreation

String s1=s.concat("software");
______________________________________________________________________________________________________

2) == operator(refreance comprator) vs equals() methods(this also ment for address or reference in stringBufer ) 
but string equals method ment for containt comperessionk, 

String s1 = new String("meera");		| StringBuffer sb1 = new StringBuffer("meera");
String s2 = new String("meera);			| StringBuffer sb2 = new StringBuffer("meera");
sys(s1 == s2);	Address compare			| sys(sb1 == sb2);
sys(s1.equals(s2));				| sys(sb1.equals(sb2));

op: 1)false 2) true				|op : 1)false 2) false 

when == become true if s1 = s2 it will return true 

in obj class their are 11 public method and one private method 

equals is also one object class method 
object is super class -----> string extends it -----> string overrides equlas method to perform the contant checking
object -----> stringbuffer extends it ----> but in string Buffer no overriden method perform so op : become false

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
case 3: Heap and String Constant pool(scp) 
1.6 (scp)--> method area, 1.7 in heap area

String s = new String("meera");  && differn String s ="meera";

in the first case two object are created || in second case one object is created

heap  				|| scp
1)when ever we use		  1)for the every laterl of string 		
new it create in heap		    create object scp area for future purpose
content meera s is the 		  no explicat referance variable internal referac var used by jvm
refreance varib			reusing same object for future purpose (not refered gradbage col) be-
				case jvm internal refer
 

2nd case it will created in the scp if their no lateral befer that
object creation not mandatory first jvm check in scp area we any obj cotains are not 
if obj is their reuse if not create one (object creation optional)

further one more ex: 2
String s1 = new String("meera");
String s2 - new String("meera");
String s3 = "meera"; string s4 = "meera";

the ques is how many object is created in heap and scp

heap   			 		|| 	scp
new keword mention 2 time so 2 obj		string later  is their jvm start create 1 scp object
						2nd 3rd 4th check scp object by jvm their so one object is created
						with one contant one object will their obj will be reused
						internal meomery utlised saved 


eg: 3 

String s = new String("durga");
s.concat("software");
s=s.concate("solution");

heap 					|| 	scp
1)s--> durga heap area object created		1)also created in scp durg
2)it created bcz of run time ref 
not referenc but durgasolution			2) object created software 
it aviable for grabage collect			3) object created solution 
3)s referenc to new object
durga solution 
above to 2 refer to garbage collector				

total 6 object created 

eg : 4

String s1 = new String("spring"); s1.concat("fall"); 
String s2 = s1.concat("winter"); s2.concat("summer");
sys(s1); sys(s2);
op: spring ,springwinter
heap				scp
s1--> spring(1)        		spring(2)
2)runtime created     		fall(4)
springfall (gb no ref)(3)
3)s2-->springwinter(5)		winter(6)
4)runtime created		summer(8)
springwintersummer(7)

total 8  object

eg 5:
String s1 =new String("you cannot change me");
string s2 =new String("you cannnot change me");
sys(s1==s2); false
String s3 ="you cannot change me";
sys(s1==s3); false
String s4 ="you cannot change me";
sys(s3==s4); true object refer to same address
string s5 ="you cannot" +"change me";---> both or constant complied at compale time
sys(s4==s5); true object refer to same address
String s6="you cannot";
String s7=s6+"change me"; s6---> refer variable
sys(s4==s7);false
final string s8 ="you cannot"; ---> final is consant
string s9 =s8+"change me";--> consant+ constant complied at compale time
sys(s4==s9);true

heap					|| 	scp
1)s1-->(you cannot change me)1			you cannot change me 2
2)s2-->(you cannot change me) 3			no refer 2
3) no obj cre					no (2)
4)no 						no (2)
5)no 						no (2)
6)no 						latiera(you cannnot)(4)
7)s7 object created(5)				lateral (change me)(5)
8) no						no(4)
9) no						no(2)

total (5);

Important notes on scp 
                                                      chennai---> refered by multiple referenc 1cr
in scp area  same object can reused multiple reference 
instead creating more obj we create one obj with multiple reference
performance improved memory operation improved advtage

problem:
if any person try change city name then all remaining will be efforted so java introdeuce immutablity
changed mean new object created

why string are immutiable --> just bcz of scp reuse object
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

why scp cocept is available only for string obj but not for stringbuffer?
string most widely used in java sp that java team provide such special memory managment 
stringbuffer maybe use or not so that they are not immutable

why string objects are immutable where as stringbuffer obj are mutable?
bcz scp in string is not bcz scp not in string buffer

inaddition to string objects any other objects are immutable in java?
all wapper class object are immutable (Short , Byte , Integer, Long,Float,Double,character,Boolean
